# Bike_Infrastructure_Project

This project utilizes data from OpenStreetMap using their API. The coding program utilized is R.

1. `Ways.RData` contains the exported paths within Berlin (including any geoprocessing). This is the filtered and cleaned data from the API; otherwise, the file size would be too large for analysis and uploading to GitHub. 
2. `amsterdam_boroughs.csv` contains the names and geographic information (acquired from the City of Amsterdam's site). Alternatively, I have converted it to `amsterdam_final.gpkg` for further geographic analysis
3. There are several files labeled `boroughs` with various extensions. These are the shape files for Berlin; you will need all of them to do any further analysis.
